## Files:

- dpr.pcapng

## Solution:

Let's open up the PCAP in Wireshark.

![capture](../assets/dreadpirate/pcap.png)

Here, we see VNC traffic being captured, which suggests that we will have to look at the VNC traffic to determine the flag.

We can start by looking at VNC events. One of the packets that jumps out is packet 3277, which contains 408 kilobytes of data (sent across multiple TCP packets):

Inside, we see some JPEG image data. Let's extract this packet out into a file by copying the contents from Wireshark, and then `binwalk` it:

```
‚ùØ binwalk bigpacket.bin

10355         0x2873          JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01
... a lot more JPEGs
```

We can extract all these images out using `binwalk`, and if we make our way through, we eventually find the one we need:
